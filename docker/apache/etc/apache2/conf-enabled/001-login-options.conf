# This file can be overridden in other configurations to enable a different set of authentication sources
#
# Apache doesn't evaluate configuration strictly from top to bottom. e.g. SetEnv is applied later then <If> directives.
# Therefore, we can't use SetEnv directly to enable or disable certain login options. So we use Define for that.
# On the other hand, Defines are not available to use in server side includes. So for login-picker.shtml to work,
# we need to use SetEnv. That is why we are Defining things in 001-login-options.conf, and then in the respective configurations
# we also set environment variables with the same name.


Define TESTUSERS_LOGIN
Define GOOGLE_LOGIN
