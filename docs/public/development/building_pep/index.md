# Getting started

Welcome to PEP development! This guide will help you get started with building and contributing to PEP.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, set up your development environment based on your operating system:

- Windows: [Setting up a PEP development machine on Windows](building-pep-on-windows.md)
- MacOS: [Building PEP on macOS](building-pep-on-macos.md)
- Linux: Install the required packages as described in the [main README](https://github.com/PEP-Repository/core/blob/main/README.md#building-on-nix)

## Git basics

Git is the version control system used by PEP. If you're new to Git, the developers have a tutorial available [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control).

## Cloning the repository

Clone the public PEP repository from GitHub:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/PEP-Repository/core.git
```

## Building PEP
