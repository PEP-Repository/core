# PEP codebase

The PEP codebase is primarily written in C++. It uses modern C++ standards and is organized into libraries and executables located in the `cpp/` directory. The codebase follows CMake for build configuration and uses Conan for dependency management.

2. [Library dependencies](library-dependencies.md)
