## Re-definitions

Some used definitions should be considered to be replaced by names that better suit their (sometimes generalised) purpose.

| Old Definition | New Definition | Reason | Status |
|--|--|--|--|
| **Participant** and **Participant Group** | **(Data) Subject** and **(Data) Subject Group** | More generalised. GDPR compatible. Note: should also require the renaming (with alias for legacy reasons) of PGAR to (D)SGAR | approval pending |
| **PEP ID** or **Participant ID** | **Origin ID** | The `Origin ID` should only be known and used in the data source(s), and could also have a relevance outside of PEP. PEP ID could mean anything. | approval pending |
| **Short Pseudonym** | **Reference ID** | Avoids confusion with other pseudonyms. More intention revealing. | approval pending |
| **Participant Alias** | **Brief Local Pseudonym** | Yet another completely different terminology (introducing *Participant* in the Local Pseudonym naming, and *Alias* where it's actually an abbreviation) creates confusion. Renaming the Short Pseudonyms could allow for this new definition. | unknown |
| **Pseudonymisation Namespace** | **(Pseudonymisation) Domain** | Compatibility with Job, and easier naming for end users. | discussion |
| **Access Groups** or **Roles** (in the case of User Groups) | **User Groups** | The definition has always mainly been about `Users` in `UserGroups`, but also `Access Groups` or `Roles` have been used as synonyms. We will try to stop using these terms to avoid confusion. | unknown |
