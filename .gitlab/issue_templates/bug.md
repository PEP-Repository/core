## Summary
<!-- Short description of the defect. A single sentence may suffice. -->



## Details
<!-- More in-depth explanation of the issue. Add whatever you think is valuable information. -->


#### Steps to reproduce
<!-- **concrete** steps to reproduce the actual behavior,
     and a description of the desired/required behavior:

1. Start the mimsy application, version 46.2.
2. Click the galumphing button.
3. Enter "snicker-snack" into the text field and confirm.

Observe that the application gimbles in the wabe. I would have expected it to gyre instead.
